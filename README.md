## Note: I'm rewriting this project from UIKit to SwiftUI. You can view the current/UIKit version here, and check out the in-progress/SwiftUI version [here](https://github.com/DaniSpringer/motivator)

# Motivator
- Need more motivation to get out and work? This app is for you.
- Simply enter your hourly rate and work hours, and the app will show you a live countdown for how much more you can make today.
## Granular Control
- You can enter what times you begin and end work, down to the exact minute
- You can choose what weekdays are your work days, and what days are your weekends
- You can enter how much you make per hour, down to the cent (so you can enter your net-pay)
## Offline
- App saves your selected start and end times, working weekdays, and hourly rate, offline
## Join The Dark Side
- App supports light and dark mode
